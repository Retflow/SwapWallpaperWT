# Swap Wallpaper in Windows Terminal 
Simple Script for swapping wallpapers in Windows Terminal
Working only with WSL

**SETUP YOUR WINDOWS TERMINAL PROFILES.JSON CONFIG:**  
change "backgroundImage" to /path/to/your/pictures/current.jpg  
you also might do this:   export PATH=$PATH:/mnt/c/Windows/System32
   
Why current.jpg? It's because this script copy your Image to current.jpg  
You can rename it in whatever you want.
Your .png images will also "converted" to .jpg.   
Everytime you change your wallpaper it also overwrites the current .jpg image.
As i said, it's an easy script and also a bad one.
Change it, write a whole new idea, just do what you want.
I just want to share my idea with you. 

Have fun with it!
  
**HOW TO USE IT:**  
  sudo chmod +x cwp.py  
  copy cwp.py to /usr/local/bin    
  USAGE:  
  cwp swap <img>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;will change your wallpaper  
  cwp list  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;will list all your images in your path    
  cwp -h
